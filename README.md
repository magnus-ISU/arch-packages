# Arch programs

This repo contains some programs that I have modified (suckless software, etc) as well as some programs that I have developed

## What should I expect in here?

A bunch of hacked together garbage that only works on my machine

## Why are you still reading this?

Go explore the repo or don't, I won't really mind

## Is this really all the software you use?

No lmao, I have some stuff ignored so that the filesize of this stays small
