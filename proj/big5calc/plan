Create a template text file and a format file which follows the text file. Create a parser which scans the format, rips data from input text files, and performs operations on them based on the format file. Then outputs scores for big 5.
Then create another program which reads the big 5 scores and creates a groff document which has nice information in it about each student's results.

DONE:
Create a google sheets file with the questionaire
TODO:
Create a parser which reads a format file and outputs values based on calculations on a file which has similar structure to the format
Create a format file based on the questionaire which the parser can use to create a person's values for the big 5
Create a program or script which reads the big 5 scores and gives the standard deviations from the mean
Create a program or script which takes the previous data and creates a groff document which has personalised information about each students results
